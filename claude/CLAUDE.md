## Agent Teams
- When `CLAUDE_TEAM_MODE` env var is set, this is an Agent Teams session with tmux split panes.
- For complex parallel tasks, use the `agent-teams` skill for orchestration guidance.
- For simple sequential or single-file tasks, a single session is more efficient.
- Do not spawn teams unless the task clearly benefits from parallelism.
